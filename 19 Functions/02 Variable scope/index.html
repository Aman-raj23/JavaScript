    <h1>Variable Scope in Functions</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>What is Scope?</h2>

    <p>Scope means where in your code a variable can be accessed.
        Think of it like the “area” in which the variable exists and can be used.</p>

    <h2>Types of Scope</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Global Scope:</strong> Variables declared outside of any function. They can be accessed anywhere in the code.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Scope:</strong> Variables declared within a function. They can only be accessed within that function.</li>
        <li><strong>Block Scope:</strong> Variables declared with `let` or `const` inside a block (like an `if` statement) are only accessible within that block.</li>
    </ul>
